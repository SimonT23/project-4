    <h1>Lore</h1>
    <div id="mainContent">
         <p>
            Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark.
            You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink
            Shrine in order to link the flame again. The protagonist is known as an Unkindled, a kind of Undead, although it
            is never fully enunciated upon what differentiates an Unkindled from other Undead. There are implications that
            an Unkindled is the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their
            bodies into ash.
            The five Lords of Cinder are Ludleth the Exiled; Aldrich, Saint of the Deep; Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss
            Watchers; the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant; and Holy King Lothric, Last Hope of His
            Line. Lords of Cinder are past beings who were successful in linking the flame, being burned remnants of their
            past selves.
    
            Like in its predecessors, the story and lore of Dark Souls 3 can be pieced together through its introductory
            cinematic, item descriptions, dialogues, and environments. The following is a transcription of the intro:
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric,
            Where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge.
            In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words.
            “The fire fades, and the lords go without thrones.”
            When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls,
            unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves.
            Aldrich, Saint of the Deep.
            Farron’s Undead Legion, The Abyss Watchers.
            And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital,
            Yhorm the Giant.
            Only, in truth... The Lords will abandon their thrones.
            and the Unkindled will rise.
            Nameless, accursed undead,
            unfit even to be cinder.
            And so it is.
            That ash seeketh embers.
        </p>
        <h2>The Unkindled</h2>
        <p>
            "Only in truth the lords will abandon their thrones and the unkindled will rise. Nameless accursed undead, unfit
            even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers."
    
            "They say these are the remains of a saint who cast himself into the bonfire. But we will never know for sure,
            for soot and ashes tell no story."
    
            As the intro says, the Unkindled are beings of ash, unworthy to ascend to become Lords of Cinder. They are
            awakened by the tolling of a bell that rings when the First Flame is in danger of fading. They awaken in the
            Cemetery of Ash and seek the embers of the First Flame. During the whole game the protagonist is called
            Unkindled, Champion of Ash or Ashen One all of which harken back to the origins of the unkindled.
    
            There are some speculations about what it means to be Unkindled. First of all, upon killing certain unkindled
            NPCs they drop ashes, meaning they were burned at some point before reviving. Thus Unkindled are perhaps either
            related to the bornfire creation process, or they are nameless Accursed undead who linked the First Flame but
            died in the process. The Lords of Cinder, on the other hand, were beings so powerful they did survive the
            linking and turned into Cinder instead of mere Ash.
    
            The first hint supporting this theory is a play between the words Cinder and Ash. The latter refers to what
            remains after a material has been burnt completely while Cinder means that it has not been consumed completely.
            The Undead throw themselves in the bonfire and fuel the Flame but they are entirely consumed in the process,
            leaving only ashes that need embers to ignite. These ashes are found numerous times throughout the journey of
            the game, implying the cyclical nature of Dark and Flame. The intro sentence "Ash seeketh embers" takes shape
            now. Embers in the game are defined as:
    
            "No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a champion’s bosom, which is precisely what makes
            their yearning for warmth so keen. Gain the strength of flame and increase max HP until death. With the strength
            of fire, the summoning signs of Unkindled become visible, and seekers of embers can be summoned to join in
            co-operation. But beware the embers may also attract invaders."
    
            From DSII we know that many generations passed and many individuals sacrificed themselves to link the Flame and
            rekindle the fire. Lords of Cinder, came many generations after, and it is rare for someone to survive the fire.
            It seems one must be powerful in a unique way to survive and even then their form changes. Gwyn was a Lord of
            Cinder, but it is clear that his form was changed by the linking and it was a great sacrifice even for one as
            great as him. A vast amount of generations passed, we would obviously have many of unkindled and, of course,
            many amount of tombs in the Cemetery of Ash. We also fight against a manifestation of all Undead who linked the
            fire, that is, the Soul of Cinder, who seems to be good at all fighting styles.
    
            Another hint supporting that Lords of Cinder did not burn completely and stayed alive after linking the fire is
            the fact that all unkindled resurrect with their human forms. All Lords of Cinder wake up with their charred
            corpses, like Ludleth, and they all seem to have gained certain amount of fire power, judging by their boss
            fights. Aldrich did not die either, he had a vision of an upcoming Age of the Deep Sea, so he started devouring
            Gods.
    
            The last detail relating the Unkindled to all of the previous Undead who sacrified themselves for the Flame is
            found in a song. The name of this song is mentioned in the intro of DSIII. when you beat DSI you see your
            character burning in the kiln and then The Nameless Song starts to play. This sad tone is played at the end of
            your quest and it is what defines your character. Our characters did everything and died a thousand of times
            just to be a sacrifice to extend the age of the gods. It happened many times, and they are nameless, no one is
            going to remember their names or write poems about them.
    
            Whatever unkindled are, their task is clear. They have to seek out the Lords Of Cinder in order to reenact
            relinking the First Flame and preserve the age of fire. They are also undead who are not fully bound by the
            hollowing process we saw in past games, needing to acquire Dark Sigils in order to go Hollow.
